      <p>I am a 27-year-old software developer from Belgium. My journey into the world of technology and computer
        science
        has been a adventure, starting as a construction worker and transitioning into a career that aligns with my true
        passion - software development.</p>
      <p>My software development career started as a self-taught front-end developer but eager to learn I continued my
        journy following a graduation in software development.</p>
      <p>Today, I proudly serve as a front-end developer at Visma Bouwsoft, working on an exciting new Saas product
        called
        “Buildmate”. opportunity, allowing me to immerse myself in the complete product development process, right from
        its
        inception to where we stand today.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to my primary role as a Front-End Developer at Visma Bouwsoft, I embarked on a side venture as a
        freelancer, working as a self-employed professional.</p>
